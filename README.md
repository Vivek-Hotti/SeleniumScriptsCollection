## > 1_YoutubeSubsCount.py

This script opens up the latest uploads in the channel mentioned, along with displaying the number of subscribers of that channel in the script-runner's terminal.<br/>

## > 2_NBAcustomJersey.py

This script basically is a custom NBA Jersey Maker. Inside the code itself, the user is needed to define their last name and their desired jersey number. The driver then redirects to ChicagoBulls Jersey Maker site where auto-clicks and aut-typing occurs to ensure the given name and jersey number are typed in. Then this custom jersey gets downloaded.
